# QTM 347 - Final  Project: Diabetes Health Indicators
This repository contains code and resources for predicting the likelihood of diabetes onset using machine learning models. Diabetes is a chronic condition with significant health implications, and early detection plays a crucial role in the effective management and prevention of complications. By leveraging machine learning techniques on relevant datasets, we aim to develop predictive models to identify individuals at risk of diabetes. We are using data found on Kaggle called the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset with data collected from the CDC.

Using this dataset, we want to answer the following question:
Which model can most accurately determine the factors (top 3) that predict whether an individual has diabetes or not?

## Using the dataset
The dataset can be downloaded using the link below. When downloading the file, there will be 3 datasets. For the purposes of our project, we used the dataset labeled "diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015" because it splits the diabetes outcome variable into a binary outcome with 0 being "does not have diabetes" and 1 being "has diabetes". The dataset does not contain any N/A values, so it does not require extra cleaning.
